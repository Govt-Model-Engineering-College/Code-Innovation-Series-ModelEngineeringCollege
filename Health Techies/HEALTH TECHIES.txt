CODE INNOVATION SERIES
Hackathon 2020


Description of the project
We have created an aadhar based dynamic national repository of medical records of citizens for an effective healthcare management.
Main Features:
* Each user will have a unique Health ID and QR code which when scanned by a registered doctor will let him/her access and manipulate the patient’s medical records.
* Paperless patient health management reduces dependency on hard copies. Thus making it easier for doctors and patients. All the same, this implements green impact.
* A two-step verification process will be done through OTP before a doctor can access a patient’s records, thus adding a double layer of security.
* Documents like X-rays, ECGs, MRI scans, etc and prescriptions can be uploaded in the patient’s records with ease. 
* Users can link their accounts with their family members so that they can view their records and vice-versa.
