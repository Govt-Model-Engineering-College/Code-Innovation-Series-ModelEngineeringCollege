Fatigue Detector
-3xpl0its.Axx


DESCRIPTION
Our team presents Fatigue-detector, mainly developed keeping in mind the present trend of online classes.
Due to this pandemic all of us are spending a lot of time on our Computers and phones to attend our classes. 
Apart from this we also spend a lot of time online working on different things.In such a situation it is natural that students would get stressed and tired.
Our project is aimed at solving this issue.Our app would help students stay awake during online classes by monitoring their eye movements. 
It would trigger an alarm in case the student accidently dozes off during online classes. It would also remind us to have sufficient intake of water from time to time. 
Moreover there is an additional feature which would give students daily tips on how to maintain their health and stay active during online classes.
