# Elevator Pitch
DevQuest is the one stop destination for all your developer needs.We bridge the gap between the Indian tech hiring scenario and the Indian technical education system by imbibing  a specially curated evaluation process that assesses practical knowledge and technical skills through our gamified upskilling platform

# Problems we are trying to solve
We are all aware of the troubles we faced as freshmen, regarding choice of a path to start our developer journey with as well as how to go about building our knowledge in that specific area. As aspiring developers, everyone has the question of how, where and what to start learning, so that they can be industry-ready. Many people fall for fake internships which ask them to pay a hefty amount to gain experience, which may not necessarily be the right path to choose. The current methods of hiring selectively tend to test the competitiveness of the candidate and not the practical knowledge that they may possess. Our college curriculum does not take into account the skills required to function as a team in the industry, making hiring and training candidates a tedious task.
