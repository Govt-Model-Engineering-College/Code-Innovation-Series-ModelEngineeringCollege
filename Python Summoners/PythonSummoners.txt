               VIRTUAL HEALTH ASSISTANT
                                      ~ Developed by Python Summoners

When we are in need of a doctor we usually approach our near and dear ones who
directs us to a doctor.But in reality ,this pandemic has separatd us from them.
But there is no need to worry as we bring up before you
"The Virtual Health Assistant", an easier way to make appointments with a
doctor. By using our program we help you to minimise human contact by many ways,
also this program is not just developed for the pandemic but can be used
whenever necessary.
Now more about our program:-
      It consists of mainly two parts.

      1) A personal patient assistant:-
        The patient by entering his or her patient number is able to view their
        personal information. Later they are asked to enter their symptoms.
        According to their symptoms, they are directed to make an appointment
        with the doctor of concerning department.Even they can decide on whether
        to make an appointment or not.

      2) An admin interface.
        Admin interface is password protected.(Password for testing : admin@123)
        Admin can add, edit, search and view patient's details.
We have made the program using C++ language and can be run using
the DOSBox Emulator.
