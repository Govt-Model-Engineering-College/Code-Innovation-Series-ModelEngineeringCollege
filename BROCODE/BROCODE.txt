Tutoria
Building A Better World One Student At A Time
In the present scenario most of the high school students arenâ€™t able to join for tuition classes either due to COVID-19 issues or even maybe due to high tuition fees. At the Same time there are many Senior students who are interested in teaching other students.
Our project connects these two groups and helps benefit both the groups 
It allows users to join course/classes provided by other students/users in a very flexible and affordable manner .

These courses would be one-on-one mode, providing an individual attention to each concept thus having a full use of the money you spent in the course .

The user would have to pay the fee when taking part in a course but it would only be sent to the tutor only if the student claims he/she is satisfied with the class thus providing transparency 

If the user feel unsatisfied by the class the tutor would have to review the contents of the class with student to ensure understanding.

We also plan to host a community chat where users can converse with other individuals regarding doubts/materials/tips, helping our community to grow bigger
