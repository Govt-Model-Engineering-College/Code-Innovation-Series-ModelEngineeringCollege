Description : The major problem hindering the development of our country is unwanted production of engineers and doctors against their whim.We believe that every child is equal in terms of intelligence ,it's the level of motivation and idea of 'why they are doing it',which differentiates them.And every child have a dream or something they are interested in but in India parents are forcing them to  a particular career just  to be safe .So basically they will just survive in the field and doesn't grow .That interest of a child might be the pushing factor which makes them wake up early in the morning and  to increase  their thirst for knowledge.So our idea is to make students, moreover their parents understand the different job opportunities available and how they are as safe  as  or more safe  to engineering and all .Not only the jobs but also the necessary skills they need to  develop at a very early stage (4th or 5th grade)
