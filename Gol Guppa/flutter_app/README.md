# flutterapp

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started


We have created an app that provides the faculty with all the resources required to take classes for the students and
monitor their learning that at the same time also provides the students with interactive and easy to access courses thus
improving their e-learning experience


A user-friendly app with multiple features like online attendance, class management, homework submission, performance reports,
extra courses, reference material  and much more managed in the most efficient and transparent manner.


Features we provide:
-Online attendance marking portal
-Regular performance reports so that guardians can track their wardsâ€™ progress
-A course page for each course where the faculty can upload new videos, assignments to be submitted and reference materials and students can access them
-Extra credits earned by the students can be later used to avail other paid courses from prestigious institutions
-Faculty can set time deadlines for the videos to be watched and assignments to be submitted, which if not completed in time, will cut off access to all the recreational apps in the mobile immediately
