    The blood delivers nutrients and oxygen to the brain. When blood does not reach any part of the brain,<br>
    permanent damage to the cells in that area occurs. It sometimes paralyzes a part of the body.<br>

    The blood that flows out in this way damages the nearby cells of those arteries. This also causes paralysis<br>
    in the major arteries that supply blood to the brain.
