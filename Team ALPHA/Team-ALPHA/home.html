        <h3  class="head1">What is a Home remedy?</h3>    
         <p class="para1">  A home remedy (sometimes also referred to as a granny cure) is a treatment to
             cure a disease or ailment that employs certain spices, herbs, vegetables, or other common items
            </p>
           <h3 class="head2">Should we use it?</h3> 
            
           <p class="para2">  Herbal medicines are generally considered to be safe and effective agents.
             Therefore, people more and more turn to herbal medicine because they believe that plant remedies are free from undesirable side effects.
            Nowadays, more and more people are turning away from conventional medicines,
             because they believe that ‘natural’ substances like medicinal plants are safer than synthetic substances. 
            It is estimated that 80% of the world population consume different forms of herbal
             products and the use of herbal medicines is growing. 
             It is estimated that the usage of herbal products increases annually at a rate of 10-20% </p></div>
