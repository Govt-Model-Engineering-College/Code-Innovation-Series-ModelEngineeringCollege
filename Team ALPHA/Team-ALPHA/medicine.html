  <h3 class="heading">1.Honey</h3>
  <img src="honey.jpg" class="image">
  <p class="para"> This natural sweetener may work just as well for a cough as over-the-counter medicines. 
      That could be especially helpful for children who aren’t old enough to take those.
       <b>But don’t give it to an infant or a toddler younger than 1.
      There’s a small risk of a rare but serious kind of food poisoning that could be dangerous for them.</b> </p>

      <h3 class="heading" >2.Ginger</h3>
  <img src="ginger.jpg" class="image">
  <p class="para"> It’s been used for thousands of years in Asian medicine to treat stomachaches, diarrhea, 
      and nausea, and studies show that it works for nausea and vomiting.
       There’s some evidence that it might help with menstrual cramps, too.
        But it’s not necessarily good for everyone. 
        <b>Some people get tummy trouble, heartburn, diarrhea, and gas because of it, and it
            may affect how some medications work.</b>
       So talk to your doctor, and use it with care. </p>

       <h3 class="heading">3.Green Tea</h3>
       <img src="Greentea.jpg" class="image">
       <p class="para">This comforting drink does more than keep you awake and alert. 
           It’s a great source of some powerful antioxidants that can protect your cells 
           from damage and help you fight disease.
            It may even lower your odds of heart disease and certain kinds of cancers, 
            like skin, breast, lung, and colon.  </p>
            <hr>
       <h3 class="heading">4.Garlic</h3>
       <img src="garlic.jpg" class="image">
       <p class="para"> Some studies show that people who eat more garlic are less 
           likely to get certain types of cancer (garlic supplements don’t seem to have the same effect).
            It also may lower blood cholesterol and blood pressure levels, but it doesn’t seem to help that much </p>
            <hr>
       <h3 class="heading">5.Cinnamon</h3>
       <img src="cinnamon.jpeg" class="image">
       <p class="para">  You may have heard that it can help control blood sugar for people who have 
           prediabetes or diabetes. But there’s no evidence that it does anything for any medical condition. 
           <b>If you plan to try it, be careful: Cinnamon extracts can be bad for your liver in large doses.</b></p>
           <hr>
       <h3 class="heading">6.Peppermint</h3>
       <img src="peppermint.jpg" class="image">
       <p class="para"> Mint has been used for hundreds of years as a health remedy.
            Peppermint oil might help with irritable bowel syndrome --
            a long-term condition that can cause cramps, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation -- and 
            it may be good for headaches as well. More studies are needed to see how much it helps and why.
             People use the leaf for other conditions, too, but
              there’s very little evidence it helps with any of them.  </p>
              <hr>
       
     <h3 class="heading">7.Turmeric</h3>
       <img src="turmeric.jpg" class="image">
       <p class="para"> This spice has been hyped as being able to help with a variety of conditions from
            arthritis to fatty liver. There is some early research to support this. 
            Other claims, such as healing ulcers and helping with skin rashes after radiation are lacking proof. 
           <b>If you try it, don’t overdo it: High doses can cause digestive problems. </b></p>
