Due to the ongoing pandemic, the education system is one that has been gravely affected. 
Schools and Teachers are also in the middle of meeting the social, emotional and academic needs of students during these challenging times.
Correcting and grading answer sheets of students has been one of the tiring jobs for the educators.
To solve that problem , we have CorrectEasy , a web application that is very easy to use and will help teachers in correcting the answersheets.
The teacher needs to upload the keywords of the questions along with the students answers and by just one click ,they will obtain the detected key words and  predicts the marks that should be given to the student.
The application also maintains the marklist for the teachers, so they can analyze it later.
