PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Our project is to create an application named "Dream Catcher" that will provide total guidance to students struggling to choose the  right career path.
We provide all the required informations about the college , entrance examinations,it's deadlines and also statistics of the growth and development of 
the course that the student have selected.
We provide an aptitude test and based on the student's interests, we guide them. Once the student gets into the college, we also provide a platform
which enables them to chat as well as play and mingle among the students. An option where they could openly share their ideas and experiences will also be provided .
Apart from generic jobs like that of a doctor or an engineer, this application helps out youngsters to follow their passion of becoming an artist or an actor.
Our aim is to help out students from the beginning of grade 9 and guide them through month long aptitude tests by renowned career guidance counselors to 
find out the true passion of the student.
Unlike other applications or websites which either provide with aptitude tests or list of colleges, we make out this application as a one-stop shop for all 
their career related confusions.
