Project Description

We have created a web-based booking system -"OCTIS" which allows users to book a token for covid testing at the nearest hospital. Presently, testing
for covid-19 requires people to either go physically to the hospital to book for the next day or use someones help. Basically there is no
centralised booking system for covid-19 testing. Such a system will help in avoiding crowds in the hospital as well as act as a convenient solution for
people.

Octis utilises a virtual queue system. Users will be able to login to the website and choose a convenient date for testing and their nearest hospital.
Hospital staff can use the administrative login to view patient list.
